            <h1>Replacing a flat tyre</h1>

            <p>If you do have a flat, you can safely change it yourself if you know how to use the jack, and are able to lift and
            position the spare tyre comfortably. Read our step-by-step guide on how to change a flat tyre.</p>

            <p>Changing a flat tyre involves several steps. Here’s a simplified guide:</p>
                <br></br>
         
            <ol>
                <li><span>Apply the the parking brake:</span> This ensures the vehicle doesn’t move</li>
                <li><span>Remove your spare tyre and the jack:</span> These are usually located in the trunk of your car</li>
                <li><span>Loosen the lug nuts:</span> Use the tyre iron from your trunk to do this</li>
                <li><span>Raise the vehicle with the jack:</span> Once the vehicle is in the air, remove the nuts entirely</li>
                <li><span>Put the spare on:</span> Make sure it’s fitted correctly</li>
                <li><span>Tighten the nuts by hand before lowering the vehicle:</span> Once the vehicle is lowered, tighten the nuts fully</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Jump start your car</h1>

            <!--add an image on how to jumpstart.-->

            <p>However, if your battery has totally run out, it's likely that simply charging it won't work. Your next option is to try
            a jump start. You'll need a jump starter pack or a set of jump leads and a 'donor' car to do this.</p>

<br></br>
            <h2>Get a second opinion</h2>

            <p>If jump starting or recharging doesn't get your car going, you may have a more serious problem. If you can get your car
            to the nearest Halfords, our in-store staff can check your battery for free and determine whether the issue is simply a
            flat car battery, or whether it could be something else, such as a fault with the alternator.</p>
<br><br>
            <h2>Replace your battery</h2>
<!--A link to find out what battery your car would need.-->
            <p>The other option is a mobile car battery replacement courtesy of our Halfords Mobile Expert service. This service brings
            a technician straight to your door and fittings can be booked directly on the website, with next-day fittings also
            available.
<br></br>            
           <p>Bear in mind that even if you manage to recharge or jump start your battery, its life may have been significantly
            shortened after a discharge - you may want to replace it at some point for a new one.</p>

<h1>How to check your oil level</h1>

<p>First, pull the dipstick out carefully and wipe any oil off it – this is so you can get an accurate reading. Then,
replace it until you hear a click, and remove it again. You should now have a fresh level of oil to measure.</p>
<br></br>
        <p>Look at how far up the dipstick the oil reaches. The stick will feature two lines or dots a set distance which indicates
           the idea amount of oil – you want your oil level to sit somewhere within this gap. If the oil level sits below the
           lowest line, then you’ll need to top up straight away.</p>
