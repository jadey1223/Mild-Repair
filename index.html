            <h1>Replacing a flat tyre</h1>

            <p>If you do have a flat, you can safely change it yourself if you know how to use the jack, and are able to lift and
            position the spare tyre comfortably. Read our step-by-step guide on how to change a flat tyre.</p>

            <p>Changing a flat tyre involves several steps. Here’s a simplified guide:</p>
                <br></br>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Apply the the parking brake:</span> This ensures the vehicle doesn’t move</li>
                <li><span>Remove your spare tyre and the jack:</span> These are usually located in the trunk of your car</li>
                <li><span>Loosen the lug nuts:</span> Use the tyre iron from your trunk to do this</li>
                <li><span>Raise the vehicle with the jack:</span> Once the vehicle is in the air, remove the nuts entirely</li>
                <li><span>Put the spare on:</span> Make sure it’s fitted correctly</li>
                <li><span>Tighten the nuts by hand before lowering the vehicle:</span> Once the vehicle is lowered, tighten the nuts fully</li>
            </ol>
