<!-- tip: make sure your tyre pressure is correct  -->

            <p>If you do have a flat, you can safely change it yourself if you know how to use the jack, and are able to lift and
            position the spare tyre comfortably. <strong>Read our step-by-step guide</strong> on how to change a flat tyre.</p>

            <p>Changing a flat tyre involves several steps. Here’s a simplified guide:</p>
                
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Apply the parking brake:</strong> This ensures the vehicle doesn’t move</li>
                <li><strong>Remove your spare tyre and the jack:</strong> These are usually located in the trunk of your car</li>
                <li><strong>Loosen the lug nuts:</strong> Use the tyre iron from your trunk to do this</li>
                <li><strong>Raise the vehicle with the jack:</strong> Once the vehicle is in the air, remove the nuts entirely</li>
                <li><strong>Put the spare on:</strong> Make sure it’s fitted correctly</li>
                <li><strong>Tighten the nuts by hand before lowering the vehicle:</strong> Once the vehicle is lowered, tighten the nuts fully</li>

                <p>However, if your battery has totally run out, it's likely that simply charging it won't work. Your next option is to try
                a jump start. You'll need a jump starter pack or a set of jump leads and a 'donor' car to do this.</p>

                <p>If jump starting or recharging doesn't get your car going, you may have a more serious problem. If you can get your car
                to the nearest Halfords, our in-store staff can check your battery for free and determine whether the issue is simply a
                lat car battery, or whether it could be something else, such as a fault with the alternator.</p>

                    <p>First, pull the dipstick out carefully and wipe any oil off it – this is so you can get an accurate reading. Then,
                    replace it until you hear a click, and remove it again. You should now have a fresh level of oil to measure.</p>

                    <p>Look at how far up the dipstick the oil reaches. The stick will feature two lines or dots a set distance which indicates
                    the idea amount of oil – you want your oil level to sit somewhere within this gap. If the oil level sits below the
                    lowest line, then you’ll need to top up straight away.</p>

                 <h1>How to check my car tax</h1>
<!--add link provided for taxation in simple form-->
                 <p>The easiest way to check the tax status of your car is on the government website, using the simple form provided. The only thing you need to know is your registration plate number.</p>

                 <p>Using the website, you'll be able to confirm:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Whether your car is taxed and when this expires</li>
                        <li>The make and colour of your vehicle </li>
                        <li>When your MOT expires</li>
                        <li>The fuel type</li>
                        <li>When the last V5C logbook was issued</li> 
                    </ul>

                 <h2>What happens if you fail to tax your vehicle?</h2>  

                 <p>You will receive a letter at your home address from the DVLA informing you of an £80 fine and advising you to tax your car as soon as possible if they find that your registered car is untaxed.</p>

                 <h2>How early can I tax my car?</h2>

                 <p>Your vehicle can be taxed up to two months before it expires, by post. The details of how to do this and any extras that need to be included can be found on the gov.uk website.</p>

                <h1>How much will my car tax be?</h1>

                <p>This depends on a variety of factors, including the type of car you drive, how old it is, how big its engine is and where you live.</p>

                <h1>What happens if you forget to tax your car?</h1>

                <p>If your vehicle is found to be untaxed, there is a penalty that you could receive either by the police or by the DVLA. The DVLA runs regular random checks within their database of registered vehicles in the UK.</p>

                <h1 id="Insurance-heading">Can I renew my tax without insurance?</h1>

                <p>The DVLA will check their database to ensure that your vehicle has a current MOT (if required) and is insured when you renew or obtain road tax via the methods described above. You must first make sure that your vehicle is insured because you cannot renew your tax if it is not. </p>

                <h2>How do I check if my car is insured?</h2>

                <p>The easiest way to check whether your car is insured is online via theMotor Insurance Database (MID). Searching the database is free to use, all you need to do is enter your vehicle registration number and the database will identify the model and make of the vehicle and let you know if it’s insured.</p>
