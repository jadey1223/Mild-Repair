<!-- tip: make sure your tyre pressure is correct  -->
<!-- tire treads -->
            <p>If you do have a flat, you can safely change it yourself if you know how to use the jack, and are able to lift and
            position the spare tyre comfortably. <strong>Read our step-by-step guide</strong> on how to change a flat tyre.</p>

            <p>Changing a flat tyre involves several steps. Here’s a simplified guide:</p>
                
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Apply the parking brake:</strong> This ensures the vehicle doesn’t move</li>
                <li><strong>Remove your spare tyre and the jack:</strong> These are usually located in the trunk of your car</li>
                <li><strong>Loosen the lug nuts:</strong> Use the tyre iron from your trunk to do this</li>
                <li><strong>Raise the vehicle with the jack:</strong> Once the vehicle is in the air, remove the nuts entirely</li>
                <li><strong>Put the spare on:</strong> Make sure it’s fitted correctly</li>
                <li><strong>Tighten the nuts by hand before lowering the vehicle:</strong> Once the vehicle is lowered, tighten the nuts fully</li>
            </ol>

                <p>However, if your battery has totally run out, it's likely that simply charging it won't work. Your next option is to try
                a jump start. You'll need a jump starter pack or a set of jump leads and a 'donor' car to do this.</p>

                <h2>Get a second opinion.</h2>

                <p>If jump starting or recharging doesn't get your car going, you may have a more serious problem. If you can get your car
                to the nearest Halfords, our in-store staff can check your battery for free and determine whether the issue is simply a
                lat car battery, or whether it could be something else, such as a fault with the alternator.</p>

            shortened after a discharge - you may want to replace it at some point for a new one.</p>

                <h1> 4. How to check your oil level.</h1>

                    <p>First, pull the dipstick out carefully and wipe any oil off it – this is so you can get an accurate reading. Then,
                    replace it until you hear a click, and remove it again. You should now have a fresh level of oil to measure.</p>

                    <p>Look at how far up the dipstick the oil reaches. The stick will feature two lines or dots a set distance which indicates
                    the idea amount of oil – you want your oil level to sit somewhere within this gap. If the oil level sits below the
                    lowest line, then you’ll need to top up straight away.</p>
