         <h1>How to check my car tax</h1>
<!--add link provided for taxation in simple form-->
         <p>The easiest way to check the tax status of your car is on the government website, using the simple form provided. The only thing you need to know is your registration plate number.</p>

         <p>Using the website, you'll be able to confirm:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Whether your car is taxed and when this expires</li>
                <li>The make and colour of your vehicle </li>
                <li>When your MOT expires</li>
                <li>The fuel type</li>
                <li>When the last V5C logbook was issued</li> 
            </ul>

         <h2>What happens if you fail to tax your vehicle?</h2>  

         <p>You will receive a letter at your home address from the DVLA informing you of an Â£80 fine and advising you to tax your car as soon as possible if they find that your registered car is untaxed.</p>

         <h2>How early can I tax my car?</h2>

         <p>Your vehicle can be taxed up to two months before it expires, by post. The details of how to do this and any extras that need to be included can be found on the gov.uk website.</p>

        <h1>How much will my car tax be?</h1>

        <p>This depends on a variety of factors, including the type of car you drive, how old it is, how big its engine is and where you live.</p>

        <h1>What happens if you forget to tax your car?</h1>

        <p>If your vehicle is found to be untaxed, there is a penalty that you could receive either by the police or by the DVLA. The DVLA runs regular random checks within their database of registered vehicles in the UK.</p>
