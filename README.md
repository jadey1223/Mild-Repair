# Mild Repair

This website is intended to target new vehicle owners who may not have much experience with vehicle maintenance and repair. The website will be useful to the target audience by providing them with the knowledge and skills they need to perform basic repairs on their own, which can save them time and money in the long run. Additionally, the website will provide information on tax and insurance, which can help new vehicle owners make informed decisions about their vehicle ownership.
